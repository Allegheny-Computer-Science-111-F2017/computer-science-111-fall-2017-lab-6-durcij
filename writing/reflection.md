# Reflection by Jordan Durci

This lab was somewhat difficult, but was still fairly straightforward.  The
main difficulties came from working out how to effectively randomize locations
and characters, which I solved by taking it one step at a time.  I did run into
issues randomizing the character to be inserted, mainly because I was trying to
randomize by selecting a character from the wrong string.  Once I fixed that,
there was an issue with the substrings immediately before and after random
characters, but that came from minor issues defining the bounds of the
substrings.

Aside from the issues above, it was fairly simple to work on, and figure out.
It was pretty fun to change the letters from the input to prep the
complementary DNA for all of the mutations.
